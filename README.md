## About

Tinoite is a get-together tool for UFABC students. Here, you can find your perfect match for everything, study groups, forming entities, relationships and more!

What we mean is:
 * New to your calculus course? Find people in the same situation as you, form a study group, interact, make friends!
 * Need to create a group for a task? Here you can find your classmates alongside their "score" based on their peer reviews from past experiences!
 * Perhaps you want something... more? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Find by similarity, like, match, chat. Everything is encrypted all the way, we have no access to any of that. Dont belive us? Just read the code!

### We use the petal stack
  
* Phoenix
  * A very 'rails-like' framework, but powered with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Simple, ultrafast, without all that [rails magic](https://medium.com/swlh/the-ups-and-downs-of-rails-magic-5a88c7f68064)
* Elixir
     * Why? It was built to create applications just like that, the functional paradigm is less prone to error and the telecom roots of the [Erland VM](https://www.erlang.org/) allows us to create lightning fast and cheap chat applications (Wich is kinda our core)
* TailwindCSS
* Alpine.js
* LiveView
